      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever struggled for ideas? Just had an idea block that won’t go away but you want to use your skills. That’s what my site does! It is a platform to give and share ideas with fellow creators! Art block? We have ideas for that! Writer’s block? We have ideas for that too! Business ideas? We even have those! Whatever ideas you need you can find! And if you have an idea but just don’t have the interest or skills to do it, you can put them on our site for others to use and benefit from!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My primary audience is new and upcoming buisness profesionals and artists. while this site will likely be used ny many audiences the target is those groups due to the lack of resources available to them enabling my platform to fill in the gaps they need filled. an additional sub audience is students who simply need ideas for projects or ideas to work with on the side. my age focus is from about 18 to 40 year olds.</p>  <!-- change this -->
